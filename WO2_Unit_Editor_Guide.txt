This Editor was created by AGamer and is used for modding Unit Data in Warriors Orochi 2.

Unit Data in warriors orochi 2 affects the units/characters but some values only affect the ai such as the weapon byte.
Which means to have the correct weapon with the moveset you chose you need to modify the weapon in the equipment menu which this editor
does not cover since that is handled in a different region.

Guide for using:

1. Place the script in the same directory as your Warriors Orochi 2 game.

2. Rename the iso file to "WO2.iso"

3. Extract the icons.zip folder in the same directory as the script since the script requires the icons(they must stay in the extracted folder)

Extra Information:

Please do not modify files the Editor creates outside of the Editor, mod the files with the Editor since the files created are custom formats
that I designed. If you modify them outside the Editor then it may cause reading and writing issues. Please credit AGamer if you 
create mods or videos using the Editor. I spent hundreds of hours building Editors for a lot of the Koei Tecmo games, please let me know if you have any questions
or problems.

Python is required if you only want to use the PYW file or you can use the Executable which does not require Python installed but the executable may
give false virus warnings due to it being a Python script converted to an executable that doesn't require Python installed.
